# General dart development rules

- Use fvm (flutter version manager) instead of dart and flutter commands direcly
- Place non-view logic files in service, utility or view controller classes
- Add unit tests for view controller class
- Run lint and test after completions
- Add widget tests for UI functionality


## Testing instructions

Running `fvm flutter run -d chrome` means the browser will open but since it can't be automatically interacted with, do not run this. Instead, finish by running a lint, test and build but not debug. If debugging is needed, I will be having a debug session open and I can manually verify any changes needed.
